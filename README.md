# Assignment-03

In this assignment, we consider a 5 x 5 gridworld problem. 

The gridworld environment consists of 25 cells (possible states). An agent can take a step up, down, left, or right. 

The agent gets a reward of -20 and goes back to the start position at (4, 0) if the agent moves to any red state. 

Meanwhile, the agent get a reward of -1 if the agent moves between any two other states or tries to step off the grid. 

The black squares are terminal states.
